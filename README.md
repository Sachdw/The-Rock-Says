This is a personal project where I adapted the code found in this tutorial from Tensorflow: 

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation 

In order to make an LSTM RNN model capable of generating short texts in the style of former professional Wrestler, the Rock.
The project involved transcribing videos of his old promos as text to create an original text file. 
The finished project is currently deployed to Heroku as a web app: https://the-rock-says.herokuapp.com/
